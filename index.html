			<h3>Kentucky Laboratory Services | Date of Employment</h3>
			<strong>December 17th 2012 to March 17th 2017</strong>
			<section>
				<p>When I first began at Kentucky Laborotory Services (or KLS for short) I was hired on as courier where I would drive to our various clients based on which route I was doing that day and pick up and transport samples that our phlebotomists and clients had collected from their patients, which included blood, urine, stool, swabs, biopsies, paps, and so on.  After this I would bring them back to either our main facility for processing and final verification and or to Saint Joseph Hosipital or Saint Joseph Hospital East for testing.</p>
				<p>After a year and a few months working there some of our departments went through a restructuring phase which mainly included my department of Logistics and as a result I was given the opportunity apply and try out for our Accessioning department, of which I passed with flying colors and was hired on without hessitation.</p>
				<p>My roles in my newly appointed position came with a lot of conditions and procedures.  Overall the process was to take the samples that were brought to us by the couriers and input the patient information and order the test that every patient needed performed to our system and also to Catholic Health Initiative or CHI, which is where the hospital and our parent facility Pathology Associates Medical Laboratory-PAML could also log records and patient information. With the samples from the patient that we received I would then enter in everything for our patient and then get labels that would say where they needed to go, either to one of the hospitals (mainly Saint Joseph Hospital) or to PAML for specialized testing. Being the only male in the lab I took on other jobs in addition to my own, these included breaking down boxes that needed to be sent to PAML, Logging in and tracking out the samples that have to go to PAML, packing every box that needed by sent to PAML which I had to become certified to do because of sending infectious materials by plane is something that can't be done without traning. These were my main tasks to complete but when you're working in a lab with minimal staff you also other things to tend to as well like making sure there aren't any samples left in our centrifuges or in our refrigerator/Freezer to be tracked</p>

		<h3>CMWA: Central Motor Wheel of America | Date of Employment</h3>
		<strong>May 2012 to September 2012</strong>
			<p>I worked at CMWA for a few months through their busy season and not conveniently during one of the hottest summers of my entire life but it was a good experience all the same. I worked in what is called "the pool" and basically I worked wherever they needed me.  In the factory there are about 30+ lines that make different sized wheels which required me to learn very quickly at each one, the responsibilities at each line weren't all the same and if I were to write the tasks at each line I would probably end up writting 2 additional pages explaining each line. I was lucky if I got to stay at one for any extended period of time like a whole week, otherwise I would be moved around every day to a new line and have to adjust to where they put me.  A lot of times a few of my co-workers and myself would end up being pulled into the storage where they kept all the completed wheel for exporting, while there we would do a very last inspection of every wheel to make sure there are no imperfections on the welding or chips in the painting. If for some reason I wasn't assigned a job for that day or nobody needed me anywhere I and whoever else was in the pool with me would stay babck in our pool area and come up with small projects to do around the our area, which could have been anything like painting the walls, painting the floor.</p>
